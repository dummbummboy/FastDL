-description-
Vertigo is based on a skyscraper that was under construction 
And centered the conflict between the Counter-Terrorist and the Terrorist teams.
The main objective for the Terrorists were to bomb the building
while the CTs must prevent them from achieving their goal.

-missions-
Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the builing from 
being destroyed.

Terrorists: Plant the bomb and blow up the
building.

Other Notes: Don't fall off.
