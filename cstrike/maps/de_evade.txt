Background: A top secret industrial facility storing
and producing nuclear weaponry for sale on the black
market has been uncovered by the SAS. These terrorists
are also linked with the bombing of old ruins in Egypt.
 
Terrorist: Avoid the Counter-Terrorists recovering the
manufactured weaponry. Destroy the evidence linking you 
to the Egyptian Attack. Detonate a bomb at either the
gas pipeline or the cargo train carrying the weaponry.

Counter-Terrorist: Eliminate the Terrorists at all
costs. Defuse any bombs threatening either of the two
bomb targets.
