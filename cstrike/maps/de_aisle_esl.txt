Aisle - Defusion (ESL Version)


Counter-Terrorists:
The terrorist forces have already brought the entire city under their control. This is bad, very bad. But it can be worse when the public notice this incident. It would be exposing our power against political opponents. We have no idea what the terrorists are planning now.
But no matter what it will be. Prevent it and sweeps these bastards away!


Terrorists:
It wasn´t easy but we had transformed the whole city into a ghost town. Well, the problem is that no one is here anymore. .. So we have to blow up something to get some Attention. The wohle State will fear us if everyone see what we are capable of. Then we are able to overthrow that State with that shitty system. Let's do it!
