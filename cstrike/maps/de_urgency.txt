----- DE_URGENCY -----
Somewhere at Middle East. Urgency, It's fun to play but dangerous to get caught in.

At noon. Based on intelligence information, the city will be bombed. Elite government troops quickly arrived to anticipate the bombing. Immediately there was a fierce bloody gunfight between the terrorists and the government's elite special forces which was inevitable.

- Watch out!. Be careful there are snipers at the location!
