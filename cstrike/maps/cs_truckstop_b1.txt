Ranch View Motel was always known for being a 
suspiciously popular place among some shady 
people of all sorts. The police made several 
raids before, however nothing illegal was found, 
as if someone warned motel owners about an 
oncoming law enforcements operation.

Everything remained quiet until recently cops 
got an anonymous call, saying that there's an 
illegal drug deal in the motel being in progress. 
What was supposed to be a covert operation quickly 
gone hot, however, as some of the officers failed 
to arrive on scene unnoticed, which caused a 
firefight with a local gang involved in the deal.

Most civillians managed to escape the scene once 
first shots were fired, however some people are still 
held captive inside, turning whole operation into a 
barricaded hostage situation. The gang members 
requested a helicopter to the hotel and a safe corridor 
to Mexico, within one hour, or else they threaten 
to kill the hostages. 

As one hour is about to run out within just few minutes, 
the cops have no other option but to start the assault...
