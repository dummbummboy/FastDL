Terrorists: After the loss of
Cobble and his summer chateau, Lord
William has, protected by a special 
force from the government, escaped 
to Austria.
Plant the C4 at either his accommodation
in the northwest, or his baggage and car 
in the south, in order to kill him or 
to prevent him from escaping again.

Counter-Terrorists: Though you don't know 
where exactly Lord William is hidden and the 
attack will take place, prevent the 
Terrorists from bombing the targets and try 
to kill all the Terrorists, avoiding furhter 
attempts on Lord William.
